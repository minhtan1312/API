    "maintext": "Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week\u2019s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.\nThis week, cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase announced that it is launching its own NFT platform to take on OpenSea, an existing NFT platform. Some techies aptly pointed out that both Coinbase and OpenSea are backed by Andreessen Horowitz, leading to questions around competitive conflicts that could arise from having a shared investor (it\u2019s unclear if a16z ever sold its shares in Coinbase after it went public).\nAs we discussed on Equity this week, the idea of having competitive companies within the same portfolio feels uncomfortable. It could impact how open each company is with its investors, and, as we saw with Hinge Health, can cause tension if there\u2019s an overlap in advisers. It\u2019s a fair argument.\nBut, is it just me, or does competitive conflict sound somewhat inevitable? As venture firms grow, especially an institution like a16z, the idea that no portfolio companies in booming sectors like fintech or crypto overlap in vision feels unrealistic. Clubhouse, another a16z-backed company, was met with an entire wave of competitors after its debut \u2014 and I joked then that it\u2019s only a matter of time until one of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies pivots to social audio, too.\nIn a world of rapid deal-making and booming subsectors, competitive conflict will continue to grow. Imitation holds startups to a higher standard. If a startup can copy your idea, and entirely win based off of that, a shared investor is likely not your problem. Sure, there should be some processes in place to make sure that your board member isn\u2019t sitting in meetings with your closest competitor, but, beyond extreme cases, the line is blurring on what should constitute conflicts.\nI\u2019m being harsh, but that\u2019s my first reaction. Your competitor can always eat your lunch, but in the great OpenSea, maybe that just means it\u2019s time to swim a little deeper.\nAs always, you can find me on Twitter @nmasc_ or listen to me on Equity. This week, I also made a guest appearance on Here & Now to talk about edtech\u2019s evolution!\nA fund for, and by, South Asian female entrepreneurs\nAs a South Asian female, I was amped to see the emerging fund manager world get a new influx of my people this week. Neythri Futures Fund announced that it has closed a $10 million fund with investments from leading South Asian men and women.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know: The fund, per founding managing partner Mythili Sankaran, brought together 200 investors, with 90% South Asian women and, here\u2019s the kicker, 70% first-time investors. It was built on AngelList, which has been working on a suite of SaaS tools for venture capitalists.\nMore money, less problems:\nClassPass has stepped off the treadmill and onto a new track\nClassPass was acquired by Mindbody in an all-stock deal that actually got half of TC staff really excited. ClassPass, for those who don\u2019t know, helps fill workout classes with consumers, while Mindbody provides the software that helps fitness centers and boutique shops better run their business.\nHere\u2019s what to know: It felt sensical and smart, two words that should be associated with acquisitions.\nBy combining forces, the Mindbody/ClassPass entity has the opportunity for huge growth. ClassPass studios that are not using a booking software \u2014 Lanman says it\u2019s about one-third of the studios on ClassPass \u2014 will now have the chance to sign up with Mindbody. Mindbody\u2019s consumer-facing business will have the chance to double down on their experience by signing up for a ClassPass subscription and get access to those studios. And, of course, gyms and studios that use Mindbody for \u00e0 la carte bookings could be upsold to ClassPass, as well. \u2014 Jordan Crook\nWhen M&A goes away:\nA tale of two travel stories\nThis week on Equity, the TechCrunch team looked at how two travel-focused startups have pivoted and rebounded their way through the pandemic. While one startup chose to focus on flexible living, another decided to go the fintech route.\nHere\u2019s what to know: TripActions went from $0 in revenue to $7.25 billion in valuation. How? Well, as Mary Ann reports, TripActions leaned into the very nascent fintech product that it launched a month before the pandemic hit, giving it growth and a way to support customers through expense management. The news reminds us all that every startup, eventually, is a fintech company.\nFintech & friends:\nAround TC\nThis week, I\u2019m going to convince you that one of the best, free ways to build a better venture-backed business is \u2026 TechCrunch Live. The weekly event, put together by some of the best internal folks at the publication, connects founders and the investors who finance them in a chill chat.\nTC interviews investors on their thought process when writing checks, pushing for specifics and reverse engineering their biggest deals to date. Then, in the latter half of each episode, founders in the audience are encouraged to jump on our virtual stage and pitch their products, receiving live feedback from our esteemed duos.\nThis past week, we had Chime founder and CEO Chris Britt with Menlo Ventures partner Shawn Carolan. In the past, we\u2019ve had Poshmark CEO Manish Chandra, Mayfield\u2019s Navin Chaddha, Planet FWD\u2019s Julia Collins and Cleo Capital\u2019s Sarah Kunst.\nTechCrunch Live is free for anyone who would like to attend live, so come hang every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT.\nAcross the week\nSeen on TechCrunch\nHow Los Angeles is preparing for the air taxi takeoff\nSoWork just convinced investors (and Tinder) that virtual co-working is here to stay\nReddit hires former Google Cloud exec as its first chief product officer\nHow to sell clothes online and actually make money\nCoinbase is launching its own NFT platform to take on OpenSea\nSeen on TechCrunch+\nInside Plaid\u2019s plans to build a new, global finance network\nSelling into the enterprise: How Slack and other startups get it wrong\nNerdWallet\u2019s IPO filing reveals high-margin content business, accelerating marketing spend\nFounders should use predictive modeling to fundraise smarter\nHow my company is winning the war for engineering talent\nTalk soon,\nN",
