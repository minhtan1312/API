First, he argued that the U.S. government should create a new regulatory framework around digital assets. Armstrong argues that regulations currently in place were built around financial intermediaries and concepts that do not apply to cryptocurrency.\nSecond, Armstrong argued that a single federal regulator should be responsible for the new framework. Currently, he says, the U.S. has an \u201cimpenetrable array of regulators.\u201d\nThird, he argued that this new framework should protect crypto investors. Fourth, he suggested that the framework should allow for fair competition and interoperability between crypto projects.\nArmstrong wrote that these suggestions are \u201cmeant to spark a conversation about regulating crypto,\u201d adding that they are \u201cnot anchored in specific products\u201d but rather a \u201chigh-level view of the changing financial system and the new technology that underpins it.\u201d\nWill the Plan Go Forward?\nIt\u2019s not clear how much influence these suggestions will have. Elsewhere, Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad said that Coinbase has met with three dozen lawmakers and that the response from the government has been \u201cwelcoming.\u201d\nCoinbase has quickly become a target for regulators in recent months. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened to sue the company over its Lend product. Coinbase was also forced to end margin trading in response to actions by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nCoinbase has also spoken out against regulations that would more broadly affect the crypto industry, including a recent crypto tax bill and rules that would force reporting of large transactions.\nIncidentally, the U.S. government has drafted its own unified approach to crypto regulation. The two plans do not seem to be compatible, as Coinbase\u2019s suggestions represent a complete overhaul of the current system.\nUltimately, it seems unlikely that the U.S.\u2019s current group of regulators will follow Coinbase\u2019s suggestions, though the company\u2019s suggestions may gain traction within the crypto industry.\nDisclaimer: At the time of writing this author held less than $75 of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins.\nShare this article",
