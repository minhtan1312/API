    "maintext": "FTX.US\u2019s nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace has expanded support to the Solana blockchain, enabling users to trade, deposit and withdraw NFTs that conform to the Metaplex token standard.\nThe United States registered branch of FTX announced the expanded functionality on Tuesday, revealing the marketplace also plans to support Ethereum-based tokens in the near future. The marketplace is open to both U.S. and non-U.S. customers from a long list of jurisdictions, however, New York residents are unable to sign up for the platform.\nBrett Harrison, president of FTX.US, said that the firm is looking to provide \u201csimpler, safer and easier tools\u201d for mainstream users to trade NFTs via its marketplace, adding:\n\u201cThe NFT ecosystem has started to infiltrate pop culture, but has been lacking a platform that provides easy access and exposure to the mainstream audience.\u201d\nIn addition to supporting crypto assets, users can purchase or bid on NFTs via bank transfers, wire transfers and credit card transactions. The pricing for newly minted NFTs on the marketplace is listed in U.S. dollars, Solana (SOL) or Ether (ETH).\nFTX charges a 2% fee on all NFT sales and does not charge a listing fee.\nBoth FTX and the company\u2019s U.S. subsidiary initially launched NFT marketplaces with limited functionality last month. Users could only create or trade NFTs minted using an interface reminiscent of Microsoft Paint, leading to a flood of hastily cobbled together sketches depicting cartoon fish being uploaded to the platform.\nOn Tuesday, Harrison tweeted that the marketplace\u2019s expanded functionality is only available on its U.S.-based platform at this stage. Users must provide identity documents and proof of residence to the exchange in order to deposit and withdraw from FTX\u2019s NFT platform.\nThe platform also outlines that any NFT project of collection that \u201cdistributes or advertises the distribution of royalties\u201d to NFT holders will be rejected, suggesting FTX.US is wary of regulators classifying its NFTs as investment products.\nRelated: Twitter and TikTok embrace NFTs: Mainstream adoption incoming?\nNFTs are seeing increasingly mainstream adoption, with the Texas Democratic Party launching a partnership with marketplace Front Row to raise funds for progressive political candidates and causes through the sale of NFTs on Monday.\n\u201cNFTs will become a powerful addition to any political fundraising effort, and the launch of our marketplace will give Democrats across the country a fundraising advantage that its counterparts do not have,\u201d said Front Row co-founder Parker Butterworth.",
