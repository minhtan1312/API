    "maintext": "FTX US Launches NFT Market \u2014 Users Can Trade and Mint Solana NFTs, ETH Support on the Way\nOn Monday, FTX US announced the launch of its marketplace for non-fungible token (NFT) assets. FTX explained that the marketplace will feature Solana-based NFTs but support for Ethereum-based NFTs is coming in the near future.\nFTX US Reveals New Solana NFT Market, Plans to Support Ethereum in the Near Future\nWest Realm Shires Services Inc., the parent company of FTX US, revealed on Monday that the U.S.-based regulated cryptocurrency exchange has launched the FTX NFTs Marketplace. The market will give FTX US users the ability to mint NFTs, as well as transfer the digital collectibles. The announcement published on October 11, indicates that the market will initially host Solana (SOL) minted non-fungible token (NFT) assets. \u201cIn the near future,\u201d FTX NFTs plans to implement Ethereum support as well.\nBrett Harrison, the president of FTX US explained during the announcement that the company has already become \u201cimmersed in the NFT ecosystem.\u201d \u201cIn learning about so many of these projects, we\u2019ve come to a comprehensive understanding of the needs of creators and collectors in the space,\u201d Harrison said in a statement. \u201cWith the launch of this platform, we hope to provide both US and global users with a regulated marketplace that is intuitive and responsive to their needs.\u201d\nFTX Joins a Slew of Competitor NFT Marketplaces Raking in Billions, Exchange to Support all Solana NFTs That Conform to the Metaplex Standard\nFTX NFTs Marketplace will indeed have a large quantity of NFT markets to compete with like Opensea, Rarible, Makersplace, Nifty Gateway, the Wax Atomicmarket, Aavegotchi, Foundation, Superrare.co, Hic et nunc, and more. Opensea by itself is nearing the $10 billion mark in terms of sales as the NFT market which supports both Ethereum and Polygon has captured $8.58 billion in all-time sales. While most of these markets do support Ethereum, some of them leverage Polygon, Tezos, Wax, BSC, and Flow.\nFTX US planning to tap into the Solana ecosystem may give the market some initial advantages by separating itself. The company detailed that it plans to work \u201cdirectly with Solana project creators to ensure authenticity verification\u201d and highlighted that bids or listings can be done with a variety of assets including USD, SOL or ETH. \u201cAll Solana NFTs that conform to the Metaplex standard will be supported on the FTX US platform,\u201d the firm\u2019s announcement further explains.\nHarrison and FTX US believe that the non-fungible token (NFT) collectible industry has gained access into our everyday lives. \u201cThe NFT ecosystem has started to infiltrate pop culture, but has been lacking a platform that provides easy access and exposure to the mainstream audience,\u201d Harrison\u2019s statement concluded.\nWhat do you think about FTX US launching an NFT marketplace that supports Solana-based NFTs?
